# Advance Java Assignment
This project is about parssing XML files containing License data.<br>
There are two xml files with various attributes for the data.<br><br>
All we need to do is parse both the files, compare them and accordingly store the data in one of the three csv files.<br>
First file contains data present in both the files.<br>
Second file contains data that is invalid.<br>
The last file contains data that is valid but is present in only one xml file.<br><br>
The project is completely about parsing the xml files accordingly.<br><br><br>
